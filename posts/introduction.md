# Welcome to C3nQ
Hello, I'm Gabriel Richard U also known by 'C3nsoreD'. This is my offical attempt at a tech blog so there will be alot of learning along the way. I have a background in Aerospace engineering but my heart lays in software development simply because I can do much more on a computer.

The idea behind this blog is to create a central place for what I learn thoughtout the week. It will mostly revovle around tech and software but not limited to that domain. If there's anything worth sharing be sure to find it here.

I hope this will serve anyone that reads this blog. For me its a record of my progress.

P.S: I learning publicly helps speed up the learning process.
