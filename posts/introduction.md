# Welcome to C3nQ

Hello, my name is Gabriel Richard U, better known as 'C3nsoreD.' This is my first official try at a tech blog, so expect to learn a lot along the road. I have a degree in aerospace engineering, but software development is my passion simply because I can accomplish so much more on a computer.

The goal of this blog is to provide a central location for everything I learn throughout the week. It will primarily revolve around technology and software, but not exclusively. If there's something worth sharing, it'll be found here.

I hope that everybody who reads this site will find this useful. It serves as a record of my development also.
